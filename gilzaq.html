      <p id='description'>You ask about Gilzaq.
<br> <br>
You ask about Gilzaq and get information on this supposed thief. They speak of a tragedy his family went through, involving the death of his wife Saria. They say the death of his wife made him go mad, looking into ways of resurrection, scrounging every possible detail he could find. Looking for a way of getting her back he stole the artifact, in hopes of attuning to its power. They say he is still stricken with grief and he wishes nothing but her back. They offer to give directions to where he is located.</p>
