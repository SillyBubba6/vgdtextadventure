      <p id='description'>You let him keep the artifact.
<br> <br>
You watch the man as he unravels the mess he has made. You decide he is better off if he can keep the artifact. He is doing no harm except to those who bother him, even the bounty on his head is of no importance, not worth that of a life. As you turn to leave he stops to look, "Thank you, I will return it once I am done,"  he manages to spout in a shaky voice. You leave him to the shambles he has left with desperate reparation, leaving a man who lived a tragedy.</p>
