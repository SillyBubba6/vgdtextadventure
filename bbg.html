      <p id='description'>You mention his tragedy.
<br> <br>
As you mention the tragedy of his family he gains a look of sorrow. He unsheathes his sword and prepares to strike. As he stands motionless his form falters, he tosses the sword across the room bouncing across the damp stone tiles. He crumples to his knees with hands quivering and tears streaming down his face. He mouths the word Saria repeatedly while what is left of his rigid form dissolves into a slumped form as you watch what remains of a man decay. </p>
