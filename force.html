      <h1 id='title'>The Brute</h1><br>
      <p id='description'>You try to resolve the situation forcefully.
<br> <br>
You brandish a blade, making clear your intentions to Gilzaq. He stares blankly as if nobody was there, he gets up slowly with a quiet rustle of his rags. He speaks, "Strike me down," in a calm and collected tone. You dash forward and strike his heart going for a killing blow, his breath starts to leave as you further push the blade in his now motionless body. His lifeless body now lays on the floor, in his pocket there is the artifact meant to be returned, you promptly grab it and return to town. Jobs like these aren't meant to be clean. </p>
